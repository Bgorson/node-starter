# TLDR

Use of this starter template assumes that you have a 'complete dev environment' setup - a terminal, Node, VS Code, at least. If not, you may want to [start here.](https://www.notion.so/codefinity/Setting-up-a-Local-Dev-Environment-for-JS-02a4e9f4a30043d3a8e7d109be3448f4)

1. Click that big green button to start using it.
2. `clone` your new repo from your GitHub to your local computer
3. `cd` into the `clone`d repo and enter: `npm i`.
4. `npm start`

## Node Starter

## Some of What's Included

- [![code style: prettier](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-prettier-ff69b4.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)
- [![Code Style](https://badgen.net/badge/code%20style/airbnb/ff5a5f?icon=airbnb)](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
- Various VS Code 'settings' and 'extensions.' Look in the bottom right when you open this up in VS Code to install them.
- [Kite ü™Å](https://www.kite.com/javascript/) is also included. I personally recommend it, but it's certainly not compulsory to set this up.
- Directories üìÇ with 'index.js' files as a suggested architecture. **See comments in those files for addl. info.**
- `dotenv` is also there!
- `.vscode/launch.json` includes debugging üêõ support. **Make sure `nodemon` is globally installed: `npm install -g nodemon`.**

## How To Use

Run `npm i` to get all the things installed.

`npm start` will watch the `app` directory for any changes using `nodemon`

**Don't 4get to ~~drink your Ovaltime~~ update `"name"`, `"description"`, `"author"`, etc. in 'package.json' when using this for your stuff.**

## üé∂

- For fonts, I set ['Victor Mono'](https://rubjo.github.io/victor-mono/) by default. You might also install: ['Inconsolata'](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inconsolata) or ['Source Code Pro'](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Code+Pro) - or completely change that in [.vscode/settings.json](/.vscode/settings.json), _if you know what you are doing! ‚ö†Ô∏è_
- As you get more comfortable, of course you can modify all the things as you C fit.
